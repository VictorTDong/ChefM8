A web application called ChefM8.

Home Kitchen provided in-person cooking classes at their studio for students to attend. As well,
they included a recipe book for purchase. Due to COVID, they have experienced a decrease in
participation and have been struggling to find a better way to provide instruction to users. They
have tried out online options for classes such as uploading tutorials on YouTube and conducting
online classes through Zoom but they feel users are not able to interact as easily as they did in
in-person classes. Since they are experiencing limited interactions, Home Kitchen requires an application that will
provide a more immersive experience to users. By allowing their customers to manage their own
recipes and learn at their own pace, Home Kitchen hopes this application will increase their
audience and provide users with a more personal experience.
